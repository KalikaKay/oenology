<h2>Theme Features</h2><h3>Featured Content Template</h3><p><strong>New in Version 3.3!</strong> Oenology now includes a featured-content template. This template can be used on the site front page, or any other static page. Your featured content is almost infinitely configurable! The featured-content template is entirely Widget-driven, and includes custom widgets for featured-content sliders, featured post-format (image/gallery/quote/status) content, calls to action, and featured pages. Content is defined as "featured" using custom post meta: just click a checkbox in the Featured Content meta box on the post-edit screen.</p><p>The following custom Widgets are included:</p><ol>	<li>Oenology Featured Content Slider: display the featured image, title, and excerpt from featured posts in a configurable slider</li>	<li>Oenology Post Formats Feature: display a configurable number of random or latest status, quote, or image posts</li>	<li>Oenology Call To Action: display a call-to-action message and link to a static page</li>	<li>Oenology Featured Page: display the featured image and excerpt of a static page</li>	<li>Oenology Featured Text: a text widget</li></ol><p>To configure, add Widgets to the "Featured Content" sidebar. Widgets are displayed in a masonry-style layout, with each custom Widget having configurable width (1-3 columns) and height (1-5 rows). You can also use any other Widget, though only the custom Widgets have configurable width and height.</p><p>Please note: this feature is still very experimental, and the styling is still fairly raw. It will be a work-in-progress (and if you are a designer and use GitHub, pull requests welcome!), and I'd love to get feedback on it so that I can continue to improve it.</p><h3>Responsive Design</h3>Oenology is a fully responsive Theme, supporting devices with display resolutions as low as 240px wide.<h3>Custom Layouts</h3><p>Oenology provides Theme options for default layouts for the site front page, blog posts index, single posts, and static pages. Additionally, using custom post meta data, Oenology supports per-post layouts for single posts and static pages. Choose from various one-, two-, and three-column layouts.</p><h3>Custom Theme Hooks</h3><p><strong>New in version 3.0!</strong> Oenology now fully supports the <a href="https://github.com/zamoose/themehookalliance">Theme Hooks Alliance</a> (THA) template hooks standard.</p><p>Custom Theme hooks provide an alternate means to modify the Oenology Theme content, without needing to modify template files. Nearly all Theme-defined content can be filtered, and most Theme template locations have associated before and after action hooks, to facilitate injection of content.</p><p>In the future, Oenology may include more UI around the custom Theme hooks (particularly, the Post-specific hooks); but for now, you can use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/oenology-hooks/">Oenology Hooks Plugin</a> for rudimentary UI access to many of the available hooks.</p><h3>Theme Customizer</h3><p>Oenology Theme options are fully integrated into the core Theme Customizer, so you can preview settings changes in real time.</p><h3>Contextual Help</h3><p>Oenology includes comprehensive Theme documentation via the Contextual Help tab on the Oenology Settings admin page, including full license information, change log, and even an integrated support tab with links to submit bug reports and to file support topics, and lists of the Oenology roadmap, and code commits and issues closed since the last release.</p><h3>Post Formats</h3><p>Oenology fully supports WordPress core Post Formats functionality. Custom layout and style are applied for each of the core Post Format types: Aside, Audio, Chat, Gallery, Image, Link, Status, and Video. Post Format archive pages are linked in the post footer of each post that uses a Post Format other than "standard". Also, Oenology includes a custom Widget to display a list of Post Format types, similar to the Category list or Tag list.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> to display captions for Gallery Post Format types, and for Image Post Format types with linked (external) images, add the caption to the <em>Excerpt</em> field on the Edit Post screen.</p><h3>Custom Navigation Menus</h3><p><strong>New in Version 2.3!</strong> Oenology now includes a footer menu, called "Footer Navigation".</p><p><strong>New in Version 2.1!</strong> The Header Navigation menu list items can now be optionally set to "fixed" or "fluid". The "fixed" option behaves as before. The "fluid" option allows for long Page Titles not to be cut off; the width of each menu list item will be determined by the length of the Page Title.</p><p>Oenology fully supports WordPress core Navigation Menu functionality. The main site navigation menu is called "Header Navigation", and the left sidebar page navigation is called "Sidebar Navigation".</p><p>The Header Navigation menu can optionally be set to display either above or below the Site Title and Description. By default, the Header Navigation menu displays above the Site Title/Description. To change this setting, see Appearance -> Oenology Options.</p><h4>Header/Sidebar Navigation Menus</h4><p>Oenology defaults to using wp_list_pages() for these menus, which means that you do not have to create your own menus. With Oenology-default functionality, any time you add pages, they will automatically appear in the menus.</p><p>The Header Navigation menu shows only top-level Pages. The Sidebar Navigation shows up to four levels of Child Pages, and shows the current Page and its Child Pages. Second-level Child Pages show from the first level, third-level Child Pages show from the second level, and fourth-level Child Pages show from the third level.</p><p>Menus are displayed as lists, with each list item being a link displaying a Page Title. The list items are styled so that overly long Page Titles will not break the layout. Long Page Titles will be cut off, and the full Page Title will appear in the tooltip when hovering over the link.</p><h4>Footer Navigation Menu</h4><p>The Footer Navigation menu defaults to display nothing if no menu is applied to this location. When the Footer Navigation menu is displayed, it displays on the right side of the footer, and the other footer content displays on the left side of the footer. If no Footer Navigation menu is displayed, the footer content displays in the center of the footer, as before.</p><p>The Footer Navigation menu displays only one level of Page hierarchy.</p><p>The number of items that can be displayed in the Footer Navigation menu is limited by the available space. If too many menu items are included, the other footer content may be pushed beneath the footer. If this happens, simply reduce the number of items included in the menu.</p><h3>Post Thumbnail Functionality</h3><p>Oenology fully supports WordPress core Post Thumbnail functionality. By default, Post Thumbnails will appear in the Post Title for Archive, Taxonomy (Category/Tag), and Search pages.</p><h3>Custom Header Image Functionality</h3><p>Oenology fully supports WordPress core Custom Header Image functionality. Oenology is configured to make the TwentyTen header images available if TwentyTen is installed. Custom images will be cropped to 1000x198px when uploaded.</p><p>Oenology will automatically apply a foreground color to the Site Header Text. If you use a custom image header, you may need to modify this text color, via Dashboard -> Appearance -> Header -> "Text Color"</p><h3>Custom Background Functionality</h3><p>Oenology fully supports WordPress core Custom Background functionality. Background image or color is applied to the BODY tag, and will appear outside Oenology content.</p><h3>Widgets</h3><p>Oenology includes some custom Widgets, namely for displaying lists of categories, tags, and post formats. For categories and tags, the custom Widgets differ from their core counterparts in that they also display an RSS feed link next to the category archive index link:</p><ol>	<li>Categories</li>	<li>Post Formats</li>	<li>Tags</li></ol>
